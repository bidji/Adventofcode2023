Note : my proposal for day05 - second part is really a mess, 5 hours to reach a solution is not something I'm proud of
I will probably do a improvment later, I know how to improve a lot my proposal (don't have to try each value, I have to 
work with ranges instead, as in a same range, only the first value is usefull)
